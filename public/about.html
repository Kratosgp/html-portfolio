<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>In 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. was involved in the conflict with the Kree and the Skrulls, and Nick Fury teamed up with Carol Danvers to save the Skrulls from the Kree and retrieve the Tesseract. Having been inspired by Danvers and witnessing firsthand how humanity is not capable of dealing with intergalactic threats, but also witnessed how someone with superpowers could be Earth's protectors when S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't enough, Fury became determined to protect the Earth from future intergalactic threats like the Kree. Since Danvers had left Earth and wouldn't be available whenever the next threat arrives, Fury sought to find individuals with incredible powers and abilities just like Danvers in hopes of bringing them together as a team to fight as Earth's protectors. The initiative was originally named "The Protector Initiative", however, after Fury saw Danvers' call-sign from the time when she was in the United States Air Force, he renamed it into the Avengers Initiative.</p>
<h3>Financing</h3>
<p>While S.H.I.E.L.D. was devoting a majority of its resources into the building of the Triskelion, Nick Fury used finances to observe remarkable or enhanced individuals, sending agents to investigate such individuals and have them placed on the Index for later encounters.[2]

  Fury had also included two of S.H.I.E.L.D. most elite agents, Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton, for the Avengers Initiative due to their unique and incredible skills that rank them above other agents. Fury always kept the modified pager he could use to call Danvers but opted against asking her to join the Avengers, instead continuing the search of other powerful individuals and only bring Danvers as a last resource.</p>
<h3>First Recruit</h3>
<p>Following Tony Stark's public announcement that he was Iron Man, Nick Fury visited him at his mansion. Fury told Stark that the world is full of incredible individuals, just like him and presented him with the Avengers Initiative.[4] However, after reading Black Widow's review on Stark, Fury decided that he was not fit for the Initiative, so S.H.I.E.L.D. listed him only as a consultant for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Avengers</h3>
<p>Loki stole the Tesseract from Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., and destroyed the base, killing eighty people during the process, causing Nick Fury to revive the project. He called in Captain America to join, and sent Black Widow to get Hulk, who was now living in a rural village in India. Meanwhile, Phil Coulson was sent to Stark Tower to retrieve Tony Stark, although he was initially disapproved from the participation in the Initiative.[11] Thor returned to Earth from Asgard in order to get his adopted brother.[11][12]
  Well look who finaly assembled 2
  
  The Avengers assemble and fight as a team
  
  After the Avengers were formed, they were not cooperating and failed to prevent Loki's escape from the Helicarrier. They believed they were not meant to be together and were thinking of disbanding the team. It was only Coulson's death that motivated them to fight the Chitauri invasion on New York City. After their victory in defeating the Chitauri, Fury and Maria Hill agree that it was the correct choice to form the team and that they will return for any future threat.</p>
