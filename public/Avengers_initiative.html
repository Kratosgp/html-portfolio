<h3>Brief</h3>
<p>The Avengers Initiative (originally conceptualized as the Protector Initiative), also known as Phase 1, was a project created by S.H.I.E.L.D. and Nick Fury to form the Avengers, a response team comprised of the most remarkable individuals humankind has to offer. The Avengers Initiative was designed to defend Earth from imminent global threats beyond the warfighting capability of conventional military forces.

  The Avengers Initiative was discarded by the World Security Council in favor of a weapons development program known as Phase 2. However, it was reactivated in 2012 as a response to the Chitauri Invasion. </p>
